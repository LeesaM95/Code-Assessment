# Code Assessment

## Description
Code Assessment is an application that allows a user to test their coding knowledge in an easy to navigate form. Users have five multiple choice questions to answer within a limited timeframe of 30 seconds. At the end of the quiz, users can submit their initials and their score. Users will be able to try retaking the quiz as many times as they'd like. 

## Visuals

## Installation
This application does not require any downloading whatsoever to run. A user will simply click on the Start Quiz button, answer the questions, and submit their score. 

## Support 
If there are any problems with the code, such as something showing up wrong, not showing up at all, text not saving or the Assessment not running, feel free to contact me at LeesaM95 on GitHub, leesamarie95@gmail.com, or the GitHub help forum. 

## Roadmap
There are a lot of things I'd like to work on for this project as I'm sure I'm sending this in with many, many bugs. I'd like to make sure the saving function works all of the way, add some more questions to truly make the Assessment an Assessment, and code in a leaderboard html file and script code so all of the scores submitted is kept in one nice and neat leaderboard. I would also love to make this available to more than just local storage, and create a Dark Mode in CSS so the colors aren't so blinding. 

## Contributing
I'm more than open to having contributors join in and make positive changes to streamline the code. As always, please message me on GitHub or via my email Leesamarie95@gmail.com to gain access. I would suggest checking under the hood to get a sense of how the code works through the console. Logging the functions will be a great way to see if everything is still functioning as I intended, or if it's decided to fall apart like soggy bread. 

Though I enjoy the help, I would like to specify that I only wish for aid in:

A. Streamlining the code so it doesn't look so messy.
B. Bug Fixes (Since I know my java code is going to end up bugged out)
C. Code enhancements, including the additions of better functions.

## Authors and Acknowledgment
As Always, I thank my instructors, my tutors, advisors, and fellow classmates for guiding me, helping, and instructing me on the right path when I was otherwise stuck. I'm consistently turning in things late due to my own terrible perfectionism, so I also appreciate the patients of the anonymous graders who seem to be handed a mountain of my work last minute.

## Project Status
This project is still ongoing, albeit slowly. I would love to implement the features described in #Roadmap, however with my time constrictions, that will have to wait until I have a little more time and knowledge under my belt.
